# Sales-Data-Analysis-Exploring Sales Metrics and Insights

## Introduction

In this documentation, we will guide you through the process of analyzing sales data to derive valuable insights. We'll calculate specific metrics, such as the average revenue per sale of 'Paseo', determine the number of sales made in the 'Government' and 'Midmarket' segments, find the total revenue generated from the sales of 'Montana' in Canada, identify the location, segment, and month with the highest units sold, and calculate the total profit made in December. The goal is to provide you with a clear and structured approach to understanding the provided sales data.

## Project Objectives and Goals

### Calculate Key Metrics:
Determine the average revenue per sale of 'Paseo', the number of sales in the 'Government' and 'Midmarket' segments, the total revenue from 'Montana' sales in Canada, the highest unit of goods sold by location, segment, and month, and the total profit for December.
